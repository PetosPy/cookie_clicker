Automated cookie clicker with Selenium

## Click The Cookie
This is a web-based game that you play by clicking the cookie as fast as you canto gain points and upgrades.
Since this is a repetitive activity and it involes a website, I used Selenium to automate the clicking of the 
cookie and at the same time buy the upgrades as soon as they are available.

## Ingredients
* Selenium
* Chrome Webdriver
* time module
